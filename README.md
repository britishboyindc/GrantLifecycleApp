Grant Lifecycle Application
=================

As part of a Force for Change grant from the [Salesforce Foundation](http://www.salesforcefoundation.org), [Bridge Farm Consulting](http://www.bridgefarmconsulting.com/) helped the [Center for American Progress](http://www.americanprogress.org/) to build a new application to help them manage the grants they receive from Foundations. 

The code is freely available to Non profits to use and update. 

ToDo:
*Add Description/Commentary to Budget/Actual Classes
